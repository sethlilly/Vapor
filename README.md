# Vapor

Minimal and responsive with a focus on typography, *Vapor* is a theme that embodies the core concept of [Ghost](http://ghost.org/)&mdash;it fades into the background, bringing the focus to your content.

Supports blog and user images; cover images, while supported in the Ghost admin, are not displayed in the theme due to theme's minimal nature and focus on typography.

Fonts embedded via Google Fonts, including Roboto Slab, Merriweather, and Open Sans Condensed.

The Ghost, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ icons are trademarks of their respective owners and are from the Casper theme, copyright (c) 2013 Ghost Foundation and released under The MIT License.

Other icons provided by [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) and released under SIL OFL 1.1.

See *Vapor* in action at [Hipster Ghost](http://hipsterghost.com/).

## Modifications

Since 1.3, blog logos and author images must be at least 100px in height and width, but do not need to be 1:1.

Since 1.2, a [LESS](http://lesscss.org) file is included which contains variables allowing you to quickly change the theme's stylesheet. However, I've chosen to exclude `less.js` from the theme and I recommend using a desktop compiler like [LESS.app for Mac](http://incident57.com/less/), [SimpLESS](http://wearekiss.com/simpless), or [Crunch!](http://crunchapp.net/) to process your LESS file.
